- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    You should use functional components if you are writing a presentational component which doesnâ€™t have its own state or needs to access a lifecycle hook.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    1. componentDidMount - rendered our component for the first time
    2. shouldComponentUpdate - We have new props update
    3. componentDidUpdate - our changes have been committed

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

   custom hooks make it insanely easy to share and reuse small pieces of code. 

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

    Tests should be conducted on your app pre-flight to check for design mistakes, usability issues and access bugs
